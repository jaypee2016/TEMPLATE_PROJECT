# TEMPLATE_PROJECT
Basic Web app built and executed by Gradle (Eclipse) and running on Gretty

* clone the project into some dir on your local PC
* go to project root directory using Windows Command Prompt (Win+R) and simply execute the Gradle command from the command line:
<b>gradlew appRun</b>

* Now you should see the Gradle telling you the URL of my awesome website:

> :appRun \n
> 15:59:13 INFO  Tomcat 8.0.33 started and listening on port 8080 \n
> 15:59:13 INFO  TEMPLATE_PROJECT runs at: \n
> 15:59:13 INFO    http://localhost:8080/TEMPLATE_PROJECT \n

* If you open the browser and go to this URL you will see the projects root directory. Just click the login.html file. Else follow the link: <a href>http://localhost:8080/TEMPLATE_PROJECT</a>

* You should be forwarded to the index page with the link to the Home page

NB: you dont need eclipse to run the project
